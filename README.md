#  Web Quiz

## Project Detials
This Project was to make a coding quiz. Using what we learned in the web API weeks. The Quiz would be started byt clicking a button then transition to multiple choice
where feedback would be given if the answer chosen was right or wrong. Wrong answers would subtract time from the time which is what was used to keep score. Once the quiz was finished
the score would be displayed initials would be kept then you would be taken to another page to then see the highscores which could be seen as a listed and cleared.

# Why
This was to combine all of what we have used making a simple html page and css styles. Then to build off of the past to weeks. Traversing the dom with the query selectores
to really show we can interect with all the elements. Wether that be hiding them until appropriate times or added new elements. We had to make a timer like the mini project that could be manipulated if the answer was wrong. Utilizing the local storage and interacting with it to display the highscores

# Problems
The timer I was able to work out through the mini project but that took me a while.
Just dealing with a large project like this with numerous elements keeping track of everythingwas a challenge

# Problems Solved
-Make a timer that counts down 
-Make the timer lose extra time for a wrong answer
-provide feedback for wrong answer
-cylce through a list of qustions
-have a highscores list that interacts with local storage
-be able to clear said list
allow the user to input their initials

# Takaways
The java logic I have had slightly more experience with than html and css so I have grasped it a little easier. But going over the solutions to all the activities really helps me get more out of them.
